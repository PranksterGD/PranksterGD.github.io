## The Morning After

#### Development Time: 2 Weeks
#### Engine: Unity
#### Role: Gameplay Programmer

RPP 4 had us make a game with a focus on story. We chose to make a game that tells the story of the morning after a lovers' quarrel.

My role shifted from a focus on UI, which I had had previously, to a stronger focus on actual gameplay. I spent most of the project ensuring that the first person controller and camera felt smooth to the player,
and handling the interaction of different types of objects.

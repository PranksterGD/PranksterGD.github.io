## The Perilous Paint Project

#### Development Time: 2 Weeks
#### Engine: Adobe Animate (Flash)
#### Role: UI/Gameplay Programmer

RPP 1 had us make a game using Flash over a course of two weeks, with the sole goal being to make a fun game.

I worked as a programmer on the project, focusing mainly on UI and UX, working on the menu system, user input, and implementing audio and animations.

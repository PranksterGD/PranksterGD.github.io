## Six Days Till Summer

#### Development Time: 2 Weeks
#### Engine: Unity
#### Role: Gameplay/Systems Programmer

RPP 5 had us make a game that used new technology. We chose to make a dating sim in VR for the HTC Vive.

During the course of the project, I got to work on getting the VR systems working, and making sure that basic VR abilities such as teleportaion and picking up and throwing objects.
Also, for the first time, I got to do some systems work, where I helped develop a dialogue and game state machine, and a dialogue system for traversing through the game's vast dialogue tree.

## Air Hockey

#### Development Time: 2 Weeks
#### Engine: C++/OpenGL
#### Role: Solo Developer

The final assignment for prog 1 class at FIEA was to make a game using a OpenGL framework provided to us by our professor. After working with Unity for RPP's, making a game using straight
C++ felt completely different. Being interested in physics and how they're programmed into games, I went ahead and incoperated the Box 2D library into the project. Using the Box 2D physics 
system, I made an air hockey game that people found hilariously challenging, and resulted in lots of laughter on presentation day.

## So You Think You Know Art? - A Developer's Blog


RPP 2 brought along a new challenge. We had to make a game that goes beyond entertainment- be that an educational game, a game to help people deal with mental disorders or simulations etc.
We were given free reign this time to choose any engine we prefered, and the team settled on using Unity. This was my firt real project using the engine, and I was the only programmer on the group.
I was a litte nervous going into it, but fortunately, one of the tech designers on the team had a lot of previous Unity experience, and he helped ease me into the workings of the engine.

Our brainstorming process started out with us throwing any ideas that came to mind, some of the other ones that were seriously considered were: alchol abuse, pet care and respecting different cultures.
Finally, the group decided to stick with art history, since we had two people with art history backgrounds, and we felt that we could use their expertise in the field to our benefit. The first iteration of the game 
simply had the player choose the right picture based on the hints provided, and we felt that the game felt too much like a study tool, and did not have enough game elements to make it truly engaging. We had a long
group meeting after the interm presentation of the game, to come up with ways through which we could make the game more entertaining, while at the same time retaining the fact the game was supposed to be educational.
After the meeting, the game evolved to its current state, where the player has to play the game of trying to keep both the professor and the audiance happy, adding another gameplay feature, and the additon of the
funny animations and memes seemed to get players more engaged in the game, making them strive to get a higher score. This led to players paying more attention the art hints, and focusing on getting the right painting,
thereby helping teach art history as well.

A lot of this project was me learning Unity and making a game using it at the same time. I got to learn a lot about the Unity Canvas system, and got to do a fair bit of UI programming, similar to my last RPP.
I also got to explore the Coroutine system that Unity has to offer, and spent time understanding how the Animator and animations work in Unity, as I implemented all the animations in the game, and also made some
simple animations where I moved the audiance in and out of the screen. Learning how the different scripts of Unity communicate with each other, and learning the component hierarchy of Unity game objects were 
also interesting experiences I had with this project. This was also the first time I programmed with C#, a language that I would come to use a lot across the rest of the semester. Working in a managed environment was
very differen from my previous past of programming in C++, and helped me learn the pros and cons of the concept of a garbage collector.

At the end of the two weeks of the project, I feel that we achieved the mission statement of making a game that was both entertaining and educational.

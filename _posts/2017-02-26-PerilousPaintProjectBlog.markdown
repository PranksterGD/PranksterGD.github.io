## The Perilous Paint Project - A Developer's Blog


The Perilous Paint Project was the first of 5 RPP rounds during our first semester at FIEA, and was my first deep dive into the world of game development. 
I worked on a group of 6 : 2 programmers, 2 producers/designers and 2 artists. Working with people from different disciplines was another first for me.
The only constraint for this round, was to make a game using Flash. Being the first game that I was making as part of a group, it turned out that using Flash wasn't as bad as I was told it would be.
Infact, using such a light engine removed some of the cognitive burden I might otherwise have had, if instead we had used an engine like Unity, in which case I would have had to work on learning how to 
make a game, and how to use Unity at the same time. Flash was a simple enough software to pick up, and in fact, over the course of the two weeks, I grew to enjoy working on it.
Working with another programmer, who had different coding styles than mine and learning how to use source control (perforce), working on files simultaneously and merging them later, were all things
I learnt while working on this project.

The concept for the game itself was pretty interesting. We had a very productive first brainstorming session, where we decided to make a game that look elements of exploration and puzzle solving, and 
incoperated them into a game not too dissimilar to breakout. What we finally arrived at was The Perilous Paint Project, a game where you have to shoot paint at invisible objects, to create 
bounce-able surfaces that the next paint pellet could then bounce off, with the main objective being to hit the ghost, but at the same time, provide the player fun side experiences, such as finding 
special items hidden throughout the different levels.

I got to understand the process of loading assets when needed, by loading the assets of the level when the level was started, and off loading the previous level's assets at the same time.
ActionScript 3.0, the language used in  Adobe Motion Builder (Flash) was fairly straightforward, and I did not have much trouble picking it up, coming from a C++ background in my undergrad.

During the course of the project, I got to work a lot on UI and gameplay programming. I programmed all the menus, and the switching between them, and gameplay such as user input and win and lose conditions.

The goal of the project was to create a fun game, and I feel that we accomplished just that, which was further reinforced at the end of the semester, when the game was one of the five nominated games
for the Game Of the Class award- the only Flash game to be nominated for the category.

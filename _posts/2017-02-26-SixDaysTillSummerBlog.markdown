## Six Days Till Summer - A Developer's Blog


Our final round of RPP had us make a game using new technology. This was the only RPP round which allowed us to have self-formed teams. The team went into the round with a preemtive plan of making a dating sim, and
the brainstorming sessions were mainly aimed at figuring out how we could incoperate new technology, such as VR or AR into a traditional dating sim.

We wanted to above and beyond just a regular dating sim. The goal was not to simply port a dating sim to a VR or AR project, but instead, to use the unique characteristics of the available technology to further
enchance with a traditional PC dating sim provides. We finally decided to make a VR game, simply because we felt that we would have more time to work with the Vive, than the Hololens, since multiple teams were planning
on working with them, and we only had a couple of them available. Unity was once again the chosen engine, so that we could make use of the well developed VR Tool Kit, something that would come in very handy,
especially since noone on the team had any prior knowledge of working with VR leading up to that point. We weren't satisfied with that, we wanted to push the boundaries even further, and we spent a good amount of time over
Thanksgiving break figuring out what more we could add that would truly make the game unique. What we finally landed at, was what would become the razor statement for our game : "Mafia meets Dating Sim". 

The game would play out as a dating sim, where you would have to get to know people and make them fall in love with you. Only, during the "date" phase of the game, where in traditional dating sims, you would answer questions based on information
learnt from talking to people, we instead took advantage of the technology available to us. One of things that people enjoy the most in VR, is the ability to throw things around. So we took this, and made it the corner stone 
of the dating part of the time. Instead of answering questions, the player had to instead find orbs relating to things their date liked, and throw them at their date. The Mafia part of the game added a secondary level of
gameplay decisions that is usually lacking in dating sims. Date prospects would continue to be taking out, by one of the characters in the game, who was jealous of the attention given by the player to other characters.
It would be the job of the player, to figure out who this person is, and keep them pacified by giving them enough attention, while at the same time, getting people they want to fall in love with them.

As a programmer, getting to work with a new piece of technology made it a very interesting two weeks for me. Almost all of the two weeks went into figuring out how VR worked, and incoperating the VRTK into our project, and
making smart build vs use decisions when it came to rolling out our own implementations or using the VRTK provided scripts. I also got to take a crack at some XML parsing, and working on a a dialogue state machine,
since the dialogue system was one of the most important parts of the game.



The game was further augmented by truly hilarous voice lines, with many, many inside jokes relating to people of the cohort, and the fact that the people you could date were people from the cohort.
The hilarous nature of the game, and the sound effects that went with it, lead to it winning the ' Most Fun Game Of The Class' award at the end of the semester.

RPP 2 brought along a new challenge. We had to make a game that goes beyond entertainment- be that an educational game, a game to help people deal with mental disorders or simulations etc.
We were given free reign this time to choose any engine we prefered, and the team settled on using Unity. This was my firt real project using the engine, and I was the only programmer on the group.
I was a litte nervous going into it, but fortunately, one of the tech designers on the team had a lot of previous Unity experience, and he helped ease me into the workings of the engine.

Our brainstorming process started out with us throwing any ideas that came to mind, some of the other ones that were seriously considered were: alchol abuse, pet care and respecting different cultures.
Finally, the group decided to stick with art history, since we had two people with art history backgrounds, and we felt that we could use their expertise in the field to our benefit. The first iteration of the game 
simply had the player choose the right picture based on the hints provided, and we felt that the game felt too much like a study tool, and did not have enough game elements to make it truly engaging. We had a long
group meeting after the interm presentation of the game, to come up with ways through which we could make the game more entertaining, while at the same time retaining the fact the game was supposed to be educational.
After the meeting, the game evolved to its current state, where the player has to play the game of trying to keep both the professor and the audiance happy, adding another gameplay feature, and the additon of the
funny animations and memes seemed to get players more engaged in the game, making them strive to get a higher score. This led to players paying more attention the art hints, and focusing on getting the right painting,
thereby helping teach art history as well.

A lot of this project was me learning Unity and making a game using it at the same time. I got to learn a lot about the Unity Canvas system, and got to do a fair bit of UI programming, similar to my last RPP.
I also got to explore the Coroutine system that Unity has to offer, and spent time understanding how the Animator and animations work in Unity, as I implemented all the animations in the game, and also made some
simple animations where I moved the audiance in and out of the screen. Learning how the different scripts of Unity communicate with each other, and learning the component hierarchy of Unity game objects were 
also interesting experiences I had with this project. This was also the first time I programmed with C#, a language that I would come to use a lot across the rest of the semester. Working in a managed environment was
very differen from my previous past of programming in C++, and helped me learn the pros and cons of the concept of a garbage collector.

At the end of the two weeks of the project, I feel that we achieved the mission statement of making a game that was both entertaining and educational.

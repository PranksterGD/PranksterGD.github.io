## So You Think You Know Art?

#### Development Time: 2 Weeks
#### Engine: Unity
#### Role: UI/Gameplay Programmer

RPP 2 came with the constraint of making a game that went beyond entertainment, but removed the constraint of Flash as an Engine. The team decided to make a game to help teach art history, using Unity.

My role on the team focused once again on a lot of UI programming, handling all of the player input, and managing the animation state machine.

## The Morning After - A Developer's Blog


RPP 4 came with a new round of constraints. This time, we had to make a game with an emphasis on story. The team once again chose Unity as the game engine for development, since we felt that it waas the best
engine for a quick two week prototype.

The brainstorming session for this round went a little different.We went about recounting memorable moments of our lives, to see if we could find something that could spark a story. We eventually came to see a 
recurring theme of love and relationships. So we went ahead and decided to make a game that tells the story of the morning after a lovers' quarrel, which also gave birth to the name- The Morning After.
Having decided the basis of our story, we then had to figure out how exactly the game would play out. Our initial design idea was to make it a third person game, so that the player could experience the story of the
character of our game. We eventually had to scrap that idea, since the amount of animations required to make a third person game was way out of scope for a two week project. So, we then decided to shift the game to be
first person, and to shift the focus of the game from purely telling the story of a game's character, to instead try and make the player step into the shoes of the character, and look at the world from the filter
of their own experiences.

Having decided to go ahead with a first person game, we thought it would be a good idea to use the first person controller provided by the Unity standard asset package. This would end up being the heart of all the
programming work that went into the project. I got my first experience working with an existing code base, and tweaking it to our own needs. The first thing we noticed was that the first person controller provided by
Unity came with a ton of extra features that weren't needed and had to be trimmed out. Secondly, we wanted to do a few things with the camera that required special attention that wasn't provided by the first person controller.
My previous experiences with Unity leading up to this helped me have a much clearer understanding of how Unity worked, and it resulted in us having a much cleaner code base than my previous projects, and I feel like we
achieved a very structured and modularised code base, which consisted of many small scripts that each provided a specific function. I also got to explore how materials work, and got to implement a simple emmisive hue over
objects.

Finally, on presentation day, we managed to get a collective reaction from all members of the audiance when the final scene of the game poped up, and we felt that we had achieved our goal of getting people
invested into the story.
